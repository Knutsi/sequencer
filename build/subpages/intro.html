<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to this experiment, and thank you for participating.  Completion will take around 30 minutes.  You will be presented with a short introduction video and three written medical cases with tools to arrive at one or more diagnosis for each case. The tools allow you or order tests and procedures done on the virtual patient, and the results of these actions will be give to you.  Once you feel you have sufficient information to diagnose the patient, you may do so and progress to the next case.
</p>
<p>
    After solving the cases, a brief form will collect some data on your feelings about the experience.
